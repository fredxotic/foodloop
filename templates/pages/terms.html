            <p>
                By accessing and using FoodLoop ("we," "our," or "us"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our platform.

                FoodLoop acts as a facilitator connecting food donors with recipients. We do not manufacture, store, or prepare the food exchanged on our platform. We are a venue for community connection, not a food retailer.
